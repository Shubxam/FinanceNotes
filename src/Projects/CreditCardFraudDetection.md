# Credit Card Fraud Detection

>[!summary] Applied Multiple predictive models on CC transaction data to predict whether a CC transaction is fraudulent or not, based on transaction amount, location and other transaction related data.


## Problem Statement
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud. This model is then used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.

## Observations about data
- Highly unbalanced(skewed) data.
	- 492 frauds in 284,807 obs.
- features are numerical values resultant of PCA transformations on original dataset.
- No metadata about original features.
- No missing values.

## Business Questions


## Todos
- [ ] Learn every terminology used in the project thoroughly.
- [ ] Identify how to do this at low level.
- [ ] Watch [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=credit+card+fraud+detection) on this topic.
- [ ] Learn more about Credit Card Frauds and how to prevent them.
- [ ] Revise Precision-Recall-f1-Confusion matrix.
- [ ] Type-1 and Type-2 error
- [ ] Revise PCA
- [ ] Test-Train-Validation data
- [ ] Underfitting vs Overfitting
- [ ] Correlation in terms of model features
- [ ] Risk of collinearity
- [ ] oversampled vs undersampled dataset

## Learnings
- Dealing with imbalanced datasets
	> Q: Why does imbalance affect model performance?
	> 
	> A: In general, we want to maximize recall while capping False Positive Rate. But you can classify a lot of charges wrong and still maintain low FPR bc you have large no of true negatives. [^1]
