> The number of years of experience does not matter as long as you have built complex projects from scratch, a burning desire to learn more, constantly improve yourself, and solve tricky problems on a daily basis. We're a small team so you can assure yourself that whatever you contribute - in terms of an engineer, or otherwise - is always heard and discussed.
